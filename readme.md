## Clients/Drivers
No official clients/drivers are available at this time.

## User Guide
The user guide will be released with the first stable release of AriaSQL for now it's best to reference executor tests or SQL1+ standard.

## Getting Started

The default user is `admin` with password `admin`.
This user has all privileges.

To update the password for the `admin` user, run the following SQL command:

```
ALTER USER admin SET PASSWORD 'newpassword';

-- To update a username
ALTER USER admin SET USERNAME 'newusername';
```

### The Server
The AriaSQL server starts when executing the binary.

```
./ariasql
```

When starting AriaSQL for the first time a variety of files will be created as seen below.
<div>
    <h1 align="center"><img width="760" src="artwork/asql2.png"></h1>
</div>

- ariaserver.yaml - The server configuration file.
- databases/ - The directory where databases and their data are stored.
- users.usrs - The file where users and their privileges are stored.
- wal.dat - The Write Ahead Log file.
- wal.dat.del - The Write Ahead Log file for deleted records. (Generated by underlaying pager)

#### Data directories
##### Windows

```
os.Getenv("ProgramData") + GetOsPathSeparator() + "AriaSQL"

i.e C:\ProgramData\AriaSQL
```

##### MacOS

```
/Library/Application Support/AriaSQL
```

##### Linux

```
/var/lib/ariasql
```


### Communicating with server
AriaSQL server uses a basic auth like mechanism to authenticate users.
The server listens on port `3695` for incoming connections.

You can configure your server settings in the `ariaserver.yaml` file.
<div>
    <h1 align="center"><img width="760" src="artwork/asql3.png"></h1>
</div>



You must encode the username and password in base64 similar to SMTP.

```
echo -n "admin\0admin" | base64

Above for example would be your base64 encoded auth string.

If you're using netcat simply pass the base64 encoded string as the first line.
```

#### Using asql - AriaSQL CLI
```
./asql -u admin -p admin -host localhost -port 3695 -tls false
```
All but username and password are optional.

You can execute `json on` or `json off` from client programs.
